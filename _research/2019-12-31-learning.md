This line of work represents a deep learning extension of the stochastic optimal control framework via Forward and Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs), developed in my doctoral dissertation (see further down bellow). The mathematical formulation of a Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) problem leads to a nonlinear PDE, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE. This motivates algorithmic development for stochastic control that combine elements of PDE theory with deep learning. The transition from a PDE formulation to a trainable neural network is done via the concept of a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). Specifically, certain PDE solutions are linked to solutions of FBSDEs, which are the stochastic equivalent of a two-point boundary value problem and can be solved using a suitably defined neural network architecture. This is known in the literature as the deep FBSDE approach; the FBSDEs are then discretized over time and solved on a neural network graph. A system of FBSDEs is shown in figure 1, an example of a deep neural network architecture used to solve this system is shown in figure 2. Further extensions of this work include safety during learning (see [CoRL2020 presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFzNnYlKBtA&feature=emb_title)). We demonstrated the scalability and applicability of the deep FBSDE controller in a finance problem, namely a 101-dimensional continuous-time stock portfolio optimization problem where the objective is to outperform the market average (see figure 3).
